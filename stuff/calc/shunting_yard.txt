take input
turn that into a token queue
output is another queue
yeet all operands straight into output
operators into a separate stack
if new operator has less or equal prio than the one it would sit on, replace old top and replace with new
retroactively check for violation
exponents get to sit with each other in stack
brackets are not really operators, special rules



also also the one in save is outdated use the copy sitting outside

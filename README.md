# uno_layer


hey, this repo will be whatever I happen to be working on.

you would be here from discord, that mess is currently sitting in 42/42_actual/c13/red_black


the stuff in src/ works, my deletion thing is sitting in jail/

typing in 'make' where you can see the Makefile next to those folders will grab the stuff thats ready and make the program

then run with './a.out ...' with whichever and however many numbers you want, separated by spaces.


the simple stuff will be sitting in the lower numbered c folders

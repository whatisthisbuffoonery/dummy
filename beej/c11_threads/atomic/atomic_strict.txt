memory_order_seq_cst	Sequential Consistency
//default, applies to all operations not in function calls
//will sync each other and everything in between
//holy lag

//opt in:
memory_order_acq_rel	Acquire/Release
memory_order_release	Release (write)
memory_order_acquire	Acquire (read)

//syncs writes and reads only for the atomic var involved.
//will sync non atomics, relaxed ops, and accesses on the same atomic var

//but not other memory_order operations

//release keeps stuff that came before it, before it
//acquire keeps stuff after



memory_order_consume	Consume
//non existant in this era


memory_order_relaxed	Relaxed
//writes stuff without lagging the program to next week
